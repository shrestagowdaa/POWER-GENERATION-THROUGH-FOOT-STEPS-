# POWER-GENERATION-THROUGH-FOOT-STEPS-
In the present scenario, the requirement for energy has been increasing in a distressing rate and the availability of the energy resources are not abundant for sustainable development and the is to establish an economical pollution free inexhaustible energy resource to compensate the increasing demands. The system generates electricity through the beats of human feet using piezoelectric materials. The pressure due to human weight when applied in the system could be converted to electrical energy for immediate/later use. The system is suitable where there are high volumes of human traffic such as markets, worship centres, shopping malls, bus stations, dancing stages, and parks. It can also be used in powering small electrical appliances and electronic gadgets such as cell phones, radio stereo, television, fan, and streetlights. Since, walking is the most common activity in human day to day life, whenever a person walks, he exhausts energy to the ground which goes as a waste. Hence to make use of this energy, we are converting it into electrical energy using piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectric effect is utilized by piezoelectric sensor producing output energy in the form of AC voltage.
